What is the energy stored in the PM at $B=0$ and $H \neq 0$

There can be no magnetic monopoles, however we talk about surface free poles. What is the explanation? Isn't this against current loop unit magnetic source explanation?


Can zero magnetic field $H=0$ condition is satisfied only when a ring magnet is considered?


After saturation, is slope equal to $\mu_{0}$?


Mechanics behind the PM normal operation hysteresis?

Is a permanent magnet a ferromagnetic material with large hysteresis loop, high coercivity?
