\subsubsection{The magnetic field}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lorentz Force
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Electric current; the conservation of charge}




\begin{itemize}
	\item current density $j$ charge per area per time
	\item drift velocity $v$
	\item charge density $\rho$ or $q(N/V)$
	\item electric current $I = \int_{S} j \cdot n dS$ charge per total area per time
\end{itemize}
basic laws of physics is that electric charge is indestructible; it is never lost or created,charge is conserved
law of the conservation of charge
